  <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>I studied to become a<a href='http://www.silversmith.com'> <span class='silver'>silversmith</a></span> at <span class='uni'>university</span> for many years but half way through switched to jewellery as I found it to be more <span class='link'>interesting</span>.</p> <p>I've worked independently since 2007 in a <span>cooperative</span> studio which meant doing nearly everything related to the business by myself.</p>

  <h1> More About ME.</h1>
  <h2>My hobbies</h2><p>I do like to induldge in the odd <span class='real'>rts</span> game whenever I have the spare time, but I've always found chess more enjoyable (there's nothing more satisfying then out thinking and crushing your opponent) so I've recently joined a chess club to horne my spartial intelligence and inprove my strategical thinking to better plan ahead</p>
  <h2>Career aspriations</h2> <p>I'm hoping to obtain a place on a <a href='http://www.foundersandcoders.org'><span class='code'>Javascript course</span></a> in September to furhter my knowledge.</p>
   <h2>My background.</h2><p> I've dabbled with computers over the years but nothing to specific, but I feel I've hit the ground running learning Html, Css and then on to Javascript! </p>
  <h2>My taste in music</h2><p>My tatse in <span class='mus'> music</span> is quite varied, from jazz to reggae and most recently I've taken a liking to classical music when coding, I've found it claims my mood, espicially during frustrating moments when things aren't working the way I had hoped for.</p>
